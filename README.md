# learning-golang

## Goals for this repository are

- Accountability : Keep me accountable to publish code everyday (small samples to large projects - anything),
- Practicality : Practice makes a person perfect, otherwise I'll just procrastinate and would never learn.
- Transperancy : This put pressure on me to stay on course, accept feedback, and act on it. Feedback is the most valuable ingredient of learning so I want as much as I can get.

## How it works?

1. Subject Issue: An umbrella issue to describe top-level subject, dump common
   resources and link to other topic level notes/issues/projects.
2. Topic Issue: Describe the specific topic, its learning resources, links to my notes and
   hands-on projects.
3. Lab Issue: Describes one hands-on project covering one topic. Useful for
   learning by tinkering and getting tactical feedback. Practice hands-on labs
   from Oreilly Kodakatas, Exercism, GoByExample, Advent of Code, and other tiny
   projects here.
4. Project Issue: Describes a larger project covering more than one topics
   and/or subjects. However, to stay objective, each project must target specific work area with
   not more than three topics/subjects covered. These helps in understanding integration obstacles, overlaps
   between topics, and find knowledge gaps. Cover tiny projects from Katas,
   #100DaysOfCode, #CloudResumeChallenge etc. here.
5. Capstone Projects: These are wholesome real-life projects specifically build
   to showcase skill-sets developed from learning and experience. Go bananas
   here, but keep in mind that objective is to showcase overall skills to
   satisfy a real-life problem statement.

## Guidelines of the game

- Keep pre-planning to the minimum
- Don't Get Stuck, Ask for Help
- SQ4R can work on Video as well
- Learn by watching is not a thing
- One tiny project every-day
- One integration project every few days
- One Capstone project every fortnight
