# learning-golang

## Goals for this repository are
- Accountability : Keep me accountable to publish code everyday (small samples to large projects - anything),
- Practicality : Practice makes a person perfect, otherwise I'll just procrastinate and would never learn.
- Transperancy : This put pressure on me to stay on course, accept feedback, and act on it. Feedback is the most valuable ingredient of learning so I want as much as I can get.

This is the place to put Practical projects, Data Structure &amp; Algorithm Excercises, Learning resources, notes, anything and everything in my journey to learn Golang and in essence software engineering.

This will follow rules of #100DaysOfCode challenge but instead of Twitter, I'll post my updates on Gopher's Slack channel and maybe in Reddit.

# Learning Goal
In the short term, I expect to familiarize with Golang and its ecosystem enough to be able to code basic CLIs or relatively simple web services. As I progress, I aim to learn and practice design patterns, DSAs, and Go packages so that I can build a bit more real-life production system.

# Structure of the repo
1. Code samples & projects will live in folders
2. Daily progress will be posted as umbrell issue with each task having a separate issue
3. Package/project ideas will live under this umbrella issue (so I can get feedback and prioritise better)
4. Issues can be a code-task (project/excercise/competition), learning-objective, or feedback
5. Every code submission will be as PR (but no semver)
6. Notes (emacs-org-mode) will be used globally and locally to accumulate learning resources, feedback, remarks, etc.
